        <section data-testid="test-about-bio">
          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate developer who discovered coding during my
            university years, and it completely transformed my perspective on
            problem-solving. What started as curiosity about how websites work
            evolved into a genuine love for creating digital experiences that
            matter. I believe technology should be accessible to everyone, which
            is why I prioritize clean code, semantic HTML, and inclusive design
            in everything I build. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring
            new frameworks, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring
            aspiring developers in my community.

          <h3>My Goals in This Program</h3>
          <p>
            Through the HNG internship, I aim to level up my skills and
            transition from building personal projects to contributing to
            real-world applications. Specifically, I want to master full-stack
            development patterns, learn to write more maintainable and scalable
            code, and understand how professional development teams collaborate
            effectively. I'm also eager to receive constructive feedback from
            experienced developers, build projects that solve actual problems,
            and ultimately land a role where I can make meaningful contributions
            to a product that impacts users' lives. Beyond technical skills, I
            hope to develop better communication habits and learn how to break
            down complex problems into manageable pieces.

        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
          <h3>Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
          <p>
            While I'm comfortable with frontend fundamentals, I sometimes
            struggle with complex state management in larger applications and
            knowing when to optimize versus when to ship. Backend development,
            especially database design and API security, feels like uncharted
            territory that both excites and intimidates me. I also need to build
            more confidence in my debugging skills—I tend to second-guess myself
            when bugs appear, rather than methodically working through them.
            Additionally, I'm working on being more comfortable with not knowing
            everything; the impostor syndrome is real, but I'm learning to see
            gaps in knowledge as opportunities rather than failures. Lastly, I
            want to get better at estimating how long tasks will take and
            managing my time more effectively under pressure.

          <h3>Note to My Future Self</h3>
          <p>
            Hey future me! Remember how nervous you felt starting this journey?
            I hope you're reading this with a smile, knowing how far you've
            come. Keep that curiosity alive—it's your superpower. Don't forget
            to celebrate small wins; every bug you fix, every feature you ship,
            every concept you finally understand is progress. Stay humble, keep
            learning, and never stop asking questions. When things get tough
            (and they will), remember why you started: you love building things
            that help people. Also, please don't forget to take breaks, drink
            water, and touch grass occasionally. Your health matters as much as
            your code. Most importantly, help others climb the ladder behind
            you—you remember how much a kind word or helpful explanation meant
            when you were starting out.

          <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            The tech industry can feel overwhelming with its constant stream of
            new frameworks, tools, and best practices. I've learned to focus on
            fundamentals rather than chasing every new trend—JavaScript is
            JavaScript whether it's vanilla, React, or Vue. I'm grateful for the
            supportive developer community; resources like MDN, Stack Overflow,
            and dev.to have been invaluable learning companions. This internship
            represents a significant step in my journey, and I'm committed to
            showing up fully, embracing challenges, and growing through
            discomfort. I believe the best code is written with empathy—for
            users, for fellow developers, and for your future self who'll
            maintain it. Here's to continuous learning, meaningful connections,
            and building a career I'm proud of!
